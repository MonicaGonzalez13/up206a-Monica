## About Me

Hi my name is Monica Gonzalez and I am a first year MURP student with a focus in TPP. I am intrested in the intersection between pblic transit, social justice, and environmentalism. I am California native from Ventura County where I previously worked with a local non-profit to educate and give tools to enviromental justice communities to become invlove in local policy decision-making with issues sorrounding air quality. I enjoy trying new foods and discovering new places to eat, hiking, and listening to live music.

## Course Description 
This course focuses on on introducing the foundations of spatial data that includes an introduction to Python, and many tools avalaible through this program. The course includes the use of real world data and how to analytically approach urban planning issues. Some of the assignments are especially design to critically think about these issues, and contribute to possible remediations. 

## My Objectives for the Course
* Gain a basic foundation for Python.
* Learn how to take data and be able to effectively present that to others in a way that is informative and easy to understand.
* Expand on proffesional skills.
* Be able to evaluate data using computer programming techniques. 

## Project Class ideas
* See the relantionship between oil wells and asthma rates in Los Angeles communities. 
* Compare rent prices to type of public transit that is avalaible (i.e.  Does income effect the type of public transit (metro or bus) readily avalible to a communities?)
* Map car accidents/collisions in LA to see if there are certain locations that are accident prone, and approaches to lowering likelihood of car collisions (i.e. signage, traffic systems, installing camera, etc.)
